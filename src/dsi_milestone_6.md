She eventually realized that those fields were about the other person.                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                               |

She jumped straight away at the first hobby, as it turned out she also liked tennis.                                                                                                                                        |                                                                               |
| Borja     | 03:33:00 | 03:43:00 | Conversation topics (Cafeteria)  | Happy, Surprised, Relaxed    | When the icon with the bored state appears, and the moderators tell her that the girl is bored, she shows surprise in a playful way, and she immediately explores other options.                                                                                                                                                              | "Vaya hombre..."                                                              |

She seemed happy when talking about a topic that interested her.                                                                                                             |                                                                               |

| Borja     | 05:00:00 | 05:10:00 | Reservations (Cafeteria)         | Surprised                    | She seemed surprised of the app making reservations automatically. However, the prototype had no indication of the current time, so she couldn't have known that 8:00 pm was 30min form then.                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                               |

Then one of the moderators asked her what she would tell the person in the case that the app showed her the phone number in advance.

| Borja     | 1:45:00  | 1:55:00  | Personal information             | Confused, Exploring, Shy              | He gives direct commands to the app, instead of interacting with the girl directly. He tries to make it easy for the app to know what he wants, but doesn't remember that we asked him to talk to the girl, not the app.                                                                                                                   | "Ehh... ver quién es Paul?"                                                               |
| Borja     | 1:54:00  | 2:11:00  | Interacting with moderator       | Happy, Surprised, Relaxed, Learning   | The moderator intercedes to remind him that the app does not require direct commands, but rather it listens to a normal conversation. He seems happy and relieved when he understands how the app interfaces with the user.                                                                                                                | "Vale, vale, así que va avanzando..."                                                     |

| Borja     | 2:35:00  | 2:45:00  | Conversation topics (Cafeteria)  | Annoyed, Confused, Surprised, Shy     | When the app transitions directly to the topic suggestions, it confused the user, breaking his mental model of the date. However, he was fast to adapt and understand how to use the information. He did think that the topic suggestions were a bit forced upon the users.                                                                | "Y entonces se supone que ahí tengo que sacar el tema así, fozado ¿no?"                   |
| Borja     | 3:20:00  | 3:30:00  | Suggested phrases (Cafeteria)    | Confused, Nervous, Exploring, Shy     | As the different conversation topics were presented to him, he recited them, but he was expectim some more interaction, or some feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | "Ehhh..."                                                                                 |

| Borja     | 4:57:00  | 5:12:00  | Conversation topics (Cafeteria)  | Happy, Learning                       | He liked the "Love" topic suggestion, because he thought that it was good to deepen the topics of conversation as the date went on. However, this also indicates that he didn't even look at the love suggestion before going through the 2 previous topics.                                                                               | "Que vaya profundizando en las preguntas, está bien."                                     |

| Borja     | 5:35:00  | 6:15:00  | Suggested phrases (Cafeteria)    | Happy, Surprised, Learning            | He showed much interest in knowing the dating status of the other person, but he didn't think the suggested sentence was subtle enough. When one of the moderators suggested that the app could know that, he jumped and seemed very interested, saying that it would be ideal if the app told you at the very beginning, before the date. | "Ah, vale, eso sería estupendo"                                                           |

The app didn't suggest anything, and the user couldn't have known what time it was.                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                           |

The app should let the user decide the exact words.                                                                                                |                                                                                           |

# Outcomes of the interviews
## Final conclutions for each interview
#### User 1: Final conclusions

**Notes on the interview:**

* She was excited when starting to use the application. 
* She was the only person who was totally confident during the interview.
* She understood the context very well, and got into the dating mental state.
* She needed the least information possible.
* The interview wasn’t interrupted at any moment and went smoothly.
* She didn’t pay much attention to the emotional indicator until the end of the date.

**Positives:**

* She seemed to enjoy herself, showing a playful attitude even when the “Bored” state appeared.
* She used the app the way we think it should be used.
* The interview went well, she understood the way to interact with the app very quickly, and wasn't too surprised by any functionality.
* She formed full sentences to interact **with the other person**, and not the app.

**Negatives:**

* The configuration window confused her, because she didn’t know what any of the options meant. When the app showed the “Mutual friends” information, she grasped the concept immediately.
* She didn’t notice that the reservation was made, it was not very clear for her.
* She felt slightly bothered by the suggestions, she felt that they were forced upon her.
* Since she was so confident, she didn’t need to pay much attention to aspects of the application such as the emotional state indicator. Therefore, not much information was gathered about these components.

#### User 2: Final conclusions

**Notes on the interview:**

* Started by giving **direct voice commands** to the app, it took some time to figure out that the application responded to him.
* Sometimes he would stop focusing on the application, and just turn to the moderators and **suggest improvements** for the app. Some of the main points:
* The app's suggestions should be less specific, let the user word the sentences themselves.
* The user should be able to make reservations at a later time.
* The emotion indicators should provide a bit more information.
* When he got used to the responsiveness of the app and he **relaxed**, he noticed the functionality on the edges (navigation, emotional status display...), which before he hadn't noticed. However, when he discovered them, he **liked these widgets** very much.
* When the app didn't tell him exactly what to do, he felt nervous and resorted back to issuing semi-direct commands (e.g. "Le pregunto si le gusta el tenis").
* He seemed **spooked** by the notion of the girl not knowing that he was using the app.
* He was very interested in knowing **information** about the girl **beforehand**, especially her relationship status.

**Positives:**

* Once he got a hang of the interaction with the app, he assimilated new functionality very quickly.
* He liked all the information the app could provide about the girl (relationship status, hobbies...).
* He noticed most of the small tweaks on the design framework, like the different sizes and orderings for the topics and the emotion indicator. He missed the favorite mark in the Hard Rock café, though.

**Negatives:**

* The responsiveness of the app was a challenge to get used to.
* The sentences were too constraining.
* He expected a bit more interactivity from the prototype, which took him out of the experience and made him nervous at times.
* He said the app was "very _Black Mirror_", which has negative connotations.

#### User 3: Final conclusions

**Notes on the interview:**

* The interviewee was unfocused on the interview goals.
* He was nervous and stuttered when he spoke.  
* He was unable to apply himself to a specific context 
* his interview was really hard and the interviewee had serious difficulties. For example, He had problems doing the  think-aloud technique.. 
* He treated the application like a Rol game (where you have to pick and follow strategies).. 
* He needed a lot of support and help.  
* The interviewee was influenced by his personal background and was reluctant to use the application. 
* The interview was interrupted and this could have affected the performance of the user while using the application (for example in his nervousness)

* Blocked on different stages of the application.
* Concentrate in other stuff or trying to read/understand everything carefully

* He found it difficult to remember functionalities. 

**Conclusions:**

* We were able to analyse someone who was nervous and who did not know how to proceed. 
* It was very different to the rest of the interviews because the interviewee was reluctant to use the application.    
* (Unexpected) The user was the only one who wanted to enter the configuration in the mid way through the date. 
* He was the only interviewee that found it difficult to remember many of the basic functionalities of the application (and some tough ones). 
* He found it difficult to put himself into a specific context 

#### User 4: Final conclusions

**Notes on the interview:**

## Findings and recommendations
#### User 1: Findings and recommendations

* Change the configuration screen to make it clear what each of the options is for (e.g. “Select which information will be displayed on the other person”).
* The “Book Now” button and message should be more prominent, to make it clear that we are making a reservation.
* A clock would be useful (either always or just on the navigation view), to know how far the reservations are.

#### User 2:  Findings and recommendations

* The sentence suggestions should be less specific, to allow the user to word them as he likes.
* A solution for the reservation times problem could be to add a clock to the screen, **and** to specify how much time there’s left until a reservation **when making the reservation** (e. g. “Pacha booked at 20:00, 30 minutes from now”).
* Progressively deepen the conversation topics as the date advances, to enter into more personal space and form stronger bonds.

#### User 3:  Findings and recommendations

* Modify the configuration window or home screen so that the user is aware that it does not make much sense to change the configuration during the date.   
* To make it more clear that the user has booked a place and specify the time (today, tomorrow, etc) remaining. Example: “You have booked ‘Pacha’ for  today at 20:00”, “20 minutes remaining”.
* To be able to cancel the booking at any time during the day. For instance: ¨I have changed my mind, we are going to a different place¨. 

#### User 4: Findings and recommendations

* In the places to book, making more evident what are her favourite places. So make them in different sizes.
* Changing the way the girl favorite restaurant is shown. (Adding a big tag, or an icon).
* Notify when the girl changes the opinion (like going to a different place).
