He reacted very well to the instructions. He understood the purpose and the way the app works.                                                                                                                                       | "Vale!"                                                                                                                                                                                      |

He looks shy and exploring what to do.                                                                                                                                                                                              | "Primero voy a configurar"                                                                                                                                                                   |

He is still looking like exploring the app slowly.                                                                                                                                                              | "Cogería primero los amigos que tenía en común y lo selecciono"                                                                                                                              |
| Jorge     | 00:40 | 00:57 | Configuration                    | Confused, Learning, Exploring, Learned a new functionality | At first, he thought he should select more than one of the elements in the list (just because the prototypes use cases). We told him he could do whatever he want (select/deselect one or more) and he got it.                                                                          | "Ah vale!

Now he wants to start dating                                                                                                                                                                                       | "Y quiero ligar algo"                                                                                                                                                                        |

So the app automatically suggests topics to say.                                                                                                                                                                                       | "Estoy pensando por dónde empezar a hablar"                                                                                                                                                  |

So he realized he should pick one of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | "Ah vale.

| Jorge     | 1:53 | 2:05 | Suggested phrases (Cafeteria)    | Learning, Exploring, Learned a new functionality           | He realized that the different sizes for the suggested sentences mean the priority or order (taking the girl preferences).                                                                                                                                                              | "Supongo que la opción que está más grande es lo que más le interesa a ella así que cogería esa"                                                                                             |

So he proposed to say some keywords.                                                                                                                                   | "Algo que no quede fuera de contexto", "que la máquina detecte lo que yo diga y que la máquina pueda inferirlo"                                                                              |

He clarified it.                                                                                                                                                             | "Para ver más caminos", "querría ver por ejemplo..."                                                                                                                                         |

We asked him what he thought about the sentences (we included one non-topic related sentence to analyze his reaction,  he started to laugh and decided to not speak about a different topic, in this case brothers-sisters). | "Pasaría de ese tema y le diría un cumplido", "Le haría caso a la aplicación".                                                                                                               |

# Final conclusions
#### User 1: Final conclusions

**Notes on the interview:**

* She was excited when starting to use the application. 
* She was the only person who was totally confident during the interview.
* She understood the context very well, and got into the dating mental state.
* She needed the least information possible.
* The interview wasn’t interrupted at any moment and went smoothly.
* She didn’t pay much attention to the emotional indicator until the end of the date.

**Positives:**

* She seemed to enjoy herself, showing a playful attitude even when the “Bored” state appeared.
* She used the app the way we think it should be used.
* The interview went well, she understood the way to interact with the app very quickly, and wasn't too surprised by any functionality.
* She formed full sentences to interact **with the other person**, and not the app.

**Negatives:**

* The configuration window confused her, because she didn’t know what any of the options meant. When the app showed the “Mutual friends” information, she grasped the concept immediately.
* She didn’t notice that the reservation was made, it was not very clear for her.
* She felt slightly bothered by the suggestions, she felt that they were forced upon her.
* Since she was so confident, she didn’t need to pay much attention to aspects of the application such as the emotional state indicator. Therefore, not much information was gathered about these components.

#### User 2: Final conclusions

**Notes on the interview:**

* Started by giving **direct voice commands** to the app, it took some time to figure out that the application responded to him.
* Sometimes he would stop focusing on the application, and just turn to the moderators and **suggest improvements** for the app. Some of the main points:
* The app's suggestions should be less specific, let the user word the sentences themselves.
* The user should be able to make reservations at a later time.
* The emotion indicators should provide a bit more information.
* When he got used to the responsiveness of the app and he **relaxed**, he noticed the functionality on the edges (navigation, emotional status display...), which before he hadn't noticed. However, when he discovered them, he **liked these widgets** very much.
* When the app didn't tell him exactly what to do, he felt nervous and resorted back to issuing semi-direct commands (e.g. "Le pregunto si le gusta el tenis").
* He seemed **spooked** by the notion of the girl not knowing that he was using the app.
* He was very interested in knowing **information** about the girl **beforehand**, especially her relationship status.

**Positives:**

* Once he got a hang of the interaction with the app, he assimilated new functionality very quickly.
* He liked all the information the app could provide about the girl (relationship status, hobbies...).
* He noticed most of the small tweaks on the design framework, like the different sizes and orderings for the topics and the emotion indicator. He missed the favorite mark in the Hard Rock café, though.

**Negatives:**

* The responsiveness of the app was a challenge to get used to.
* The sentences were too constraining.
* He expected a bit more interactivity from the prototype, which took him out of the experience and made him nervous at times.
* He said the app was "very _Black Mirror_", which has negative connotations.

#### User 3: Final conclusions

**Notes on the interview:**

* The interviewee was unfocused on the interview goals.
* He was nervous and stuttered when he spoke.  
* He was unable to apply himself to a specific context 
* his interview was really hard and the interviewee had serious difficulties. For example, He had problems doing the  think-aloud technique.. 
* He treated the application like a Rol game (where you have to pick and follow strategies).. 
* He needed a lot of support and help.  
* The interviewee was influenced by his personal background and was reluctant to use the application. 
* The interview was interrupted and this could have affected the performance of the user while using the application (for example in his nervousness)

**Positives:**

* Interest in the application and trying to learn how to use it.
* Blocked on different stages of the application.
* Concentrate in other stuff or trying to read/understand everything carefully
* He was slow to react due to the fear of failure. 
* He found it difficult to remember functionalities. 

**Conclusions:**

* We were able to analyse someone who was nervous and who did not know how to proceed. 
* It was very different to the rest of the interviews because the interviewee was reluctant to use the application.    
* (Unexpected) The user was the only one who wanted to enter the configuration in the mid way through the date. 
* He was the only interviewee that found it difficult to remember many of the basic functionalities of the application (and some tough ones). 
* He found it difficult to put himself into a specific context 

#### User 4: Final conclusions

**Notes on the interview:**
* He understand very well the indications on the interview.
* We didn’t provide many information and he got it well.
* He was relaxed and confident.
* Changing the place to a class was better. There were more space and he was more relaxed.

* The 2-moderator interview worked really well and they did a great team together.
* The prototype *man in the shadow* worked well with the user goals.

**Positives:**
* He made a very good think-aloud process.
* He got that different sizes mean more importance (and girl preferences).
* He had more experience when dating.
* He was very active and asked many questions. But we didn’t provide the result, just some tips. So the user could find his own solutions.
* He liked the sentences and proposed topics.
* He didn’t feel awkward and he enjoyed the experience.

**Conclusions:**
* This user has previously experienced on this situations so he made a good role-play exercise.
* He was really comfortable. So we made a good decision to make the interview in a different place.
* This user is one of the target of our applications and he worked really well with it.
* He liked to see the emotions of the girl. Because he had problems when knowing the user states and he liked the colors.

* This user found the application really intuitive and it helped a lot on a date.

# Report of findings and recommendations
#### User 1: Findings and recommendations

* Change the configuration screen to make it clear what each of the options is for (e.g. “Select which information will be displayed on the other person”).
* The “Book Now” button and message should be more prominent, to make it clear that we are making a reservation.
* A clock would be useful (either always or just on the navigation view), to know how far the reservations are.

#### User 2:  Findings and recommendations

* The sentence suggestions should be less specific, to allow the user to word them as he likes.
* A solution for the reservation times problem could be to add a clock to the screen, **and** to specify how much time there’s left until a reservation **when making the reservation** (e. g. “Pacha booked at 20:00, 30 minutes from now”).
* Progressively deepen the conversation topics as the date advances, to enter into more personal space and form stronger bonds.

#### User 3:  Findings and recommendations

* Modify the configuration window or home screen so that the user is aware that it does not make much sense to change the configuration during the date.   
* To make it more clear that the user has booked a place and specify the time (today, tomorrow, etc) remaining. Example: “You have booked ‘Pacha’ for  today at 20:00”, “20 minutes remaining”.
* To be able to cancel the booking at any time during the day. For instance: ¨I have changed my mind, we are going to a different place¨. 

#### User 4: Findings and recommendations

* In the places to book, making more evident what are her favourite places. So make them in different sizes.
* Changing the way the girl favorite restaurant is shown. (Adding a big tag, or an icon).
* Notify when the girl changes the opinion (like going to a different place).
