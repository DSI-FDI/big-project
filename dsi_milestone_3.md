#Design Framework
##Plan and execution
As we were all in different places for this phase, we had to take a highly distributed approach to this milestone’s work. Furthermore, due to poor connection, most of the time videochat wasn’t even an option, so we had to work asynchronously as well.

##Form factor, posture and input methods
Since our app makes heavy use of Augmented Reality (AR), we decided that the form factor should cover the entire viewport, with high-resolution overlay elements that appear directly in the line of sight of the user. However, as will be detailed later, one of the users’ concerns was that the app would require too much attention and would gen in the way of their date. Therefore, we must strive to make the notifications and controls subtle.

Outside of a date, just before it starts, the app could have a **sovereign posture**, since the users wanted to know details about their dates beforehand, such as biography, goals and aspirations. Thus, it would be useful to display this dense information before the date starts, since it’s the time when the user will have the most urgent need for it. On the other hand, once in the date, the app should sit in the background and only notify the user when there is critical information, such as a dangerous topic approaching or a topic suggestion when the conversations runs out. Therefore, during the date, the app should adopt a **daemonic posture**.
